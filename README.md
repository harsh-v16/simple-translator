# Simple Translator (Vowel Replacer)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that translates a phrase by replacing all vowels with the letter g or G, depending on the case of the original vowel.

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works:

- Loops through each letter in the input phrase
- If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u):
  - Replaces it with G if it was uppercase
  - Replaces it with g if it was lowercase
- If the letter is not a vowel, it is added to the final output as-is

---

## ðŸ§ª Example:

*Input: To be or not to be
*Output: Tg bg gr ngt tg bg

---

## ðŸ›  Skills Practiced:
- String manipulation
- for loops
- Conditional logic
- Function definition
